  Abstract                 = {{A recent experiment [Vandenberghe, N., Zhang, J. \& Childress, S. (2004) J. Fluid Mech. 506, 147--155] has shown that an axle-mounted blade can spontaneously rotate when oscillated (or '' flapped'') above a critical frequency in a fluid. To understand the nature of flapping locomotion we study numerically the dynamics of a simple body, flapped up and down within a viscous fluid and free to move horizontally. We show here that, at sufficiently large '' frequency Reynolds number,'' unidirectional locomotion emerges as an attracting state for an initially nonlocomoting body. Locomotion is generated in two stages: first, the fluid field loses symmetry by an instability similar to the classical von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n instability; and second, precipitous interactions with previously shed vortical structures '' push'' the body into locomotion. Body mass and slenderness play central and unexpected roles in each stage. Conceptually, this work demonstrates how locomotion can be transduced from the simple oscillations of a body through an interaction with its fluid environment.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Summary: This paper discusses the mathematical framework for
 designing methods of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Matching (LDM) for
 image registration in computational anatomy. After reviewing the geometrical
 framework of LDM image registration methods, we prove a theorem showing that
 these methods may be designed by using the actions of diffeomorphisms on the
 image data structure to define their associated momentum representations as
 (cotangent-lift) momentum maps. To illustrate its use, the momentum map
 theorem is shown to recover the known algorithms for matching landmarks,
 scalar images, and vector fields. After briefly discussing the use of this
 approach for diffusion tensor (DT) images, we explain how to use momentum
 maps in the design of registration algorithms for more general data
 structures. For example, we extend our methods to determine the
 corresponding momentum map for registration using semidirect product groups,
 for the purpose of matching images at two different length scales. Finally,
 we discuss the use of momentum maps in the design of image registration
 algorithms when the image data is defined on manifolds instead of vector
 spaces.}},

The particle trajectories obey SDEs driven by a uniform Wiener process; the inviscid Weber formula for the Euler equations of ideal fluids is used to recover the velocity field. This method admits a self-contained proof of local existence for the nonlinear stochastic system and can be extended to formulate stochastic representations of related hydrodynamic-type equations, including viscous Burgers equations and Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes alpha models. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Kelvin's circulation theorem and its implications for potential vorticity (PV) conservation are among the most fundamental concepts in ideal fluid dynamics. In this note, we discuss the numerical treatment of these concepts with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and related methods. We show that SPH satisfies an exact circulation theorem in an interpolated velocity field, and that, when appropriately interpreted, this leads to statements of conservation of PV and generalized enstrophies. We also indicate some limitations where the analogy with ideal fluid dynamics breaks down.},

  Abstract                 = {This study derives geometric, variational discretizations of continuum theories arising in fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and the dynamics of complex fluids. A central role in these discretizations is played by the geometric formulation of fluid dynamics, which views solutions to the governing equations for perfect fluid flow as geodesics on the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain. Inspired by this framework, we construct a finite-dimensional approximation to the diffeomorphism group and its Lie algebra, thereby permitting a variational temporal discretization of geodesics on the spatially discretized diffeomorphism group. The extension to MHD and complex fluid flow is then made through an appeal to the theory of Euler-Poincar\'{e} systems with advection, which provides a generalization of the variational formulation of ideal fluid flow to fluids with one or more advected parameters. Upon deriving a family of structured integrators for these systems, we test their performance via a numerical implementation of the update schemes on a cartesian grid. Among the hallmarks of these new numerical methods are exact preservation of momenta arising from symmetries, automatic satisfaction of solenoidal constraints on vector fields, good long-term energy behavior, robustness with respect to the spatial and temporal resolution of the discretization, and applicability to irregular meshes.},

Chapter 1 provides a review of basic results in the theory of dynamical systems, covering both ordinary differential equations and discrete mappings. Chapter 2 presents 4 examples from nonlinear oscillations. Chapter 3 contains a discussion of the methods of local bifurcation theory for flows and maps, including center manifolds and normal forms. Chapter 4 develops analytical methods of averaging and perturbation theory. Close analysis of geometrically defined two-dimensional maps with complicated invariant sets is discussed in chapter 5. Chapter 6 covers global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations. The final chapter shows how the global bifurcations reappear in degenerate local bifurcations and ends with several more models of physical problems which display these behaviors." \#<I>Book Review - </I> <I>Engineering Societies Library, New York</I>\#1 "An attempt to make research tools concerning `strange attractors' developed in the last 20 years available to applied scientists and to make clear to research mathematicians the needs in applied works.

  Abstract                 = {{Lagrangian reduction by stages is used to derive the Euler-Poincare
 equations for the nondissipative coupled motion and micromotion of
 complex fluids. We mainly treat perfect complex fluids (PCFs) whose
 order parameters are continous material variables. These order
 parameters may be regarded geometrically either as objects in a vector
 space, or as coset spaces of Lie symmetry groups with respect to
 subgroups that leave these objects invariant, Examples include liquid
 crystals superfluids, Yang-Mills magnetofluids and spin-glasses. A
 Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamics for perfect complex
 fluids is obtained by Legendre transforming the Euler-Poincare
 formulation. These dynamics are also derived by using the Clebsch
 approach. In the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of perfect
 complex fluid dynamics Lie algebras containing two-cocycles arise as a
 characteristic feature.
 After discussing these geometrical formulations of the dynamics of
 perfect complex fluids, we give an example of how to introduce defects
 into the order parameter as imperfections (e.g., vortices) that carry
 their own momentum. The defects inky move relative to the Lagrangian
 fluid material and thereby produce additional reactive forces and
 stresses.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper is concerned with modeling the dynamics of N articulated
 solid bodies submerged in an ideal fluid. The model is used to analyze
 the locomotion of aquatic animals due to the coupling between their
 shape changes and the fluid dynamics in their environment.
 The equations of motion are obtained by making use of a two-stage
 reduction process which leads to significant mathematical and
 computational simplifications. The first reduction exploits particle
 relabeling symmetry: that is, the symmetry associated with the
 conservation of circulation for ideal, incompressible fluids. As a
 result, the equations of motion for the submerged solid bodies can be
 formulated without explicitly incorporating the fluid variables. This
 reduction by the fluid variables is a key difference with earlier
 methods, and it is appropriate since one is mainly interested in the
 location of the bodies, not the fluid particles.
 The second reduction is associated with the invariance of the dynamics
 under superimposed rigid motions. This invariance corresponds to the
 conservation of total momentum of the solid-fluid system. Due to this
 symmetry, the net locomotion of the solid system is realized as the sum
 of geometric and dynamic phases over the shape space consisting of
 allowable relative motions, or deformations, of the solids. In
 particular, reconstruction equations that govern the net locomotion at
 zero momentum, that is, the geometric phases, are obtained.
 As an illustrative example, a planar three-link mechanism is shown to
 propel and steer itself at zero momentum by periodically changing its
 shape. Two solutions are presented: one corresponds to a
 hydrodynamically decoupled mechanism and one is based on accurately
 computing the added inertias using a boundary element method. The
 hydrodynamically decoupled model produces smaller net motion than the
 more accurate model, indicating that it is important to consider the
 hydrodynamic interaction of the links.}},

We regard the internal configuration of a deformable body, together with its position and orientation in ambient space, as a point in a trivial principal fiber bundle over the manifold of body deformations. We obtain connections on such bundles which describe the nonholonomic constraints, conservation laws, and force balances to which certain propulsors are subject, and contruct and analyze control-affine normal forms for different classes of systems. We examine the applicability of results involving geometric phases to the practical computation of trajectories for systems described by single connections. We propose a model for planar carangiform swimming based on reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for the interaction of a rigid body and an incompressible fluid, accounting for the generation of thrust due to vortex shedding through controlled coupling terms. We investigate the correct form of this coupling experimentally with a robotic propulsor, comparing its observed behavior with that predicted numerically. },

  Abstract                 = {In some previous papers, a geometric description of Lagrangian mechanics on Lie algebroids has been developed. In this topical review, we give a Hamiltonian description of mechanics on Lie algebroids. In addition, we introduce the notion of a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic Lie algebroid and we prove that the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) dynamics on Lie algebroids may be described in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic Lie algebroids. The Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) formalism on Lie algebroids permits us to deal with Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) functions not defined necessarily on tangent (cotangent) bundles. Thus, we may apply our results to the projection of Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) functions which are invariant under the action of a symmetry Lie group. As a consequence, we obtain that Lagrange--Poincar{\'e} (Hamilton--Poincar{\'e}) equations are the Euler--Lagrange (Hamilton) equations associated with the corresponding Atiyah algebroid. Moreover, we prove that Lagrange--Poincar{\'e} (Hamilton--Poincar{\'e}) equations are the local equations defining certain Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic Atiyah algebroids.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade numerous mathematical models have been formulated to investigate specific components of the clotting system such as the tissue factor pathway of coagulation. Sophisticated, multiscale models were developed to better understand the interplay of flow-mediated transport, platelet deposition, and coagulation kinetics, and their overall effect on thrombus formation. Promotion of thrombus growth is partially due to the well-known pro-coagulant roles of platelets like the surface-dependent coagulation reactions. Iterations of theoretical model predictions and experiment have helped to elucidate anticoagulant roles of platelets as well. These roles include paving over the subendothelium and hindering transport of substrates to and from enzyme complexes which can strongly affect thrombus formation. In this review, we give a brief overview of theoretical models of thrombus formation under flow and some of the experiments that motivated them and were motivated by them.},

  Abstract                 = {{Most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic
 perturbations during their lifetime. In this study, we provide evidence
 that rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body
 kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment
 that are not self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial
 swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake
 characteristics. We compared trout swimming in the Karman street behind
 different diameter cylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and
 4.5 L s(-1), where L is total body length) to trout swimming in the free
 stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylinders
 adopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order
 to hold station, which we term the Karman gait. During this gait, body
 amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming
 at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat
 frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming
 in the reduced flow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex
 shedding frequency of the cylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing
 to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder (drafting),
 trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the
 shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism that may not involve
 propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive when cylinder
 diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trout have a
 longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicating
 that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a
 consistent manner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that
 fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to
 maintain station in downstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in
 front of a cylinder display lower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave
 speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments, implying
 that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a
 fish to hold station near a cylinder.}},

Although animals living in fluid environments commonly capture energy from vortices, experimental data on the hydrodynamics and neural control of interactions between fish and vortices are lacking. We used quantitative flow visualization and electromyography to show that trout will adopt a novel mode of locomotion to slalom in between experimentally generated vortices by activating only their anterior axial muscles. Reduced muscle activity during vortex exploita- tion compared with the activity of fishes engaged in undulatory swimming suggests a decrease in the cost of locomotion and provides a mechanism to understand the patterns of fish distributions in schools and riverine environments.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the dynamics of three point vortices in the plane is analysed in terms of Nambu mechanics and compared to the classical Hamiltonian dynamics. Two new aspects are introduced: (i) the motion of three point vortices can be classified as non-canonical Nambu mechanics and (ii) Nambu mechanics leads to a geometric representation of the trajectories in an adapted three-dimensional phase space without explicitly solving the differential equations. Thereby, the point vortex trajectory is given by the intersection of two conserved quantities as surfaces in the phase space. These constitutive quantities are the total energy and an angular momentum based Casimir function of the dynamical system. The topological structure of the last surface represents a one- or two- sheeted hyperboloid, a cone or an ellipsoid in the phase space. Examples of the periodic motion and a novel aspect of the collapse of three point vortices in the unbounded plane are discussed. Furthermore, an approach to generalize Nambu mechanics for an arbitrary number of point vortices is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In this article we develop a computationally tractable model for swimming in animals such as eels, lampreys, and aquatic snakes. The model combines motoneuronal activation, muscle dynamics, passive elasticity and damping in the spinal cord and body tissues, and simplified hydrodynamic reaction forces, thus allowing us to probe how neuromechanical interactions give rise to body shapes and, ultimately, motion through the water. We use it to investigate the sources of an interesting experimental observation in freely swimming fish: that waves of curvature propagating along the body lag behind and travel more slowly than the muscular activation waves measured by electromyography. By selectively ``lesioning'' components of the model, we deduce that the speed difference, at least in this type of fish, is largely due to passive viscoelasticity and body geometry. We also find that nonlinear muscle properties are responsible for a significant reduction in energy expenditure and that they can also contribute to the wave speed difference. This work is a key step in a general program to build integrated ``whole animal'' models of locomotion and other behaviors that will also allow us to incorporate proprioceptive and exteroceptive neural feedback. Such integrated models can contribute both to our understanding of how living systems work and to the further development of robot systems.</p>

 may result in improved underwater propulsion mechanisms. We use a
 geometric framework to consider the simplified problem of an articulated
 two-dimensional body in a potential flow. This paper builds upon the
 current geometric theory by showing that although the group of Euclidean
 transformations is non-Abelian, certain tools available for Abelian
 groups may still be exploited, making use of the semidirect-product
 structure of this group. In particular, the holonomy in the rotation
 component may be explicitly computed as a function of the area enclosed
 by a path in shape space. We use this tool to develop open-loop gaits
 for an articulated body with two shape variables, using plots of the
 curvature of the mechanical connection, which relates motion in the
 shape space to motion of the overall body. Results from numerical
 computations of the mechanical connection are compared to theoretical
 results assuming the joints are hydrodynamically decoupled. Finally, we
 consider a simple method for trajectory tracking in the plane, using a
 one-parameter family of gaits.}},

  Abstract                 = {The lack of reliable forecasts for the spread of oceanic and atmospheric contamination hinders the effective protection of the ecosystem, society, and the economy from the fallouts of environmental disasters. The consequences can be dire, as evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to predict major short-term changes in environmental contamination patterns, such as oil spills in the ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our approach is based on new mathematical results on the objective (frame-independent) identification of key material surfaces that drive tracer mixing in unsteady, finite-time flow data. Some of these material surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), turn out to admit highly attracting cores that lead to inevitable material instabilities even under future uncertainties or unexpected perturbations to the observed flow. These LCS cores have the potential to forecast imminent shape changes in the contamination pattern, even before the instability builds up and brings large masses of water or air into motion. Exploiting this potential, the LCS-core analysis developed here provides a model-independent forecasting scheme that relies only on already observed or validated flow velocities at the time the prediction is made. We use this methodology to obtain high-precision forecasts of two major instabilities that occurred in the shape of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is achieved using simulated surface currents preceding the prediction times and assuming that the oil behaves as a passive tracer.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents a geometric picture of a deformable body in a perfect fluid and a way to approximate its dynamics and the motion, resulting from cyclic shape deformations, of the body and, interestingly, the fluid as well. Emphasis is placed on the group structure of the configuration space of the body fluid system and the resulting symmetry in their equations of motion. Symmetry is also used to reduce a series expansion for the flow of a time dependent vector field in order to obtain a novel expansion for the path-ordered exponential. This can be used to approximate holonomy, or geometric phase, in a principal bundle when its evolution is governed by a connection on the bundle and it is subject to periodic shape inputs. Simple models for swimming in and the stirring of a perfect fluid are proposed and examined.},

Excellent numerical behavior is observed. A longer term goal is to use these integration methods in the context of control of mechanical systems, such as coordinated groups of underwater vehicles. In fact, numerical evidence given in related problems, such as those in Kane et al. (2000) shows that in the presence of external forces, these methods give superior predictions of energy behavior.}},

  Abstract                 = {Animal movements result from a complex balance of many different forces. Muscles produce force to move the body; the body has inertial, elastic, and damping properties that may aid or oppose the muscle force; and the environment produces reaction forces back on the body. The actual motion is an emergent property of these interactions. To examine the roles of body stiffness, muscle activation, and fluid environment for swimming animals, a computational model of a lamprey was developed. The model uses an immersed boundary framework that fully couples the Navier--Stokes equations of fluid dynamics with an actuated, elastic body model. This is the first model at a Reynolds number appropriate for a swimming fish that captures the complete fluid-structure interaction, in which the body deforms according to both internal muscular forces and external fluid forces. Results indicate that identical muscle activation patterns can produce different kinematics depending on body stiffness, and the optimal value of stiffness for maximum acceleration is different from that for maximum steady swimming speed. Additionally, negative muscle work, observed in many fishes, emerges at higher tail beat frequencies without sensory input and may contribute to energy efficiency. Swimming fishes that can tune their body stiffness by appropriately timed muscle contractions may therefore be able to optimize the passive dynamics of their bodies to maximize peak acceleration or swimming speed.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive the equations of motion for a planar rigid body of circular
 shape moving in a 2D perfect fluid with point vortices using symplectic
 reduction by stages. After formulating the theory as a mechanical system
 on a configuration space which is the product of a space of embeddings
 and the special Euclidian group in two dimensions, we divide out by the
 particle relabeling symmetry and then by the residual rotational and
 translational symmetry. The result of the first stage reduction is that
 the system is described by a non-standard magnetic symplectic form
 encoding the effects of the fluid, while at the second stage, a careful
 analysis of the momentum map shows the existence of two equivalent
 Poisson structures for this problem. For the solid-fluid system, we
 hence recover the ad hoc Poisson structures calculated by Shashikanth,
 Marsden, Burdick and Kelly on the one hand, and Borisov, Mamaev, and
 Ramodanov on the other hand. As a side result, we obtain a convenient
 expression for the symplectic leaves of the reduced system and we shed
 further light on the interplay between curvatures and cocycles in the
 description of the dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a reduction theory for Dirac structures that includes, in a unified way, reduction of both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. It includes the reduction of variational principles and in particular, the Hamilton-Pontryagin variational principle. It also includes reduction theory for implicit Lagrangian systems that could be degenerate and have constraints.

In this paper we focus on the special case in which the configuration manifold is a Lie group G. In our earlier papers we established the link between the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle and Dirac structures. We begin the paper with the reduction of this principle. The traditional view of Poisson reduction in this case is to reduce T*G with its natural Poisson structure to g * with its Lie-Poisson structure. However, the basic step of reducing Hamilton's phase space principle already shows that it is important to use g ‚{\"a}{\"\i} g * for the reduced space, rather than just g * . In this way, our construction includes both Euler-Poincar√{\copyright} as well as Lie-Poisson reduction. The geometry behind this procedure, which we call Lie-Dirac reduction starts with the standard (i.e., canonical) Dirac structure on T*G (which can be viewed either symplectically or from the Poisson viewpoint) and for each {\OE}º ‚{\`a}{\`a} g * , produces a Dirac structure on g ‚{\"a}{\"\i} g * . This geometry then simultaneously supports both Euler-Poincar√{\copyright} and Lie-Poisson reduction.

In the last part of the paper, we include nonholonomic constraints, and illustrate this construction with Suslov systems in nonholonomic mechanics, both from the Euler-Poincar√{\copyright} and Lie-Poisson viewpoints.},

This variational formulation incorporates, in a natural way, the generalized Legendre transformation, which enables one to treat degenerate Lagrangian systems. The definition of this generalized Legendre transformation makes use of natural maps between iterated tangent and cotangent spaces. Then, we develop an extension of the classical Lagrange‚{\"A}{\`\i}d‚{\"A}{\^o}Alembert principle called the Lagrange‚{\"A}{\`\i}d‚{\"A}{\^o}Alembert‚{\"A}{\`\i}Pontryagin principle for implicit Lagrangian systems with constraints and external forces. A particularly interesting case is that of nonholonomic mechanical systems that can have both constraints and external forces. In addition, we define a constrained Dirac structure on the constraint momentum space, namely the image of the Legendre transformation (which, in the degenerate case, need not equal the whole cotangent bundle). We construct an implicit constrained Lagrangian system associated with this constrained Dirac structure by making use of an Ehresmann connection. Two examples, namely a vertical rolling disk on a plane and an L ‚{\"A}{\`\i} C circuit are given to illustrate the results.},
