\section{Clarifications to comments on the revised paper}

\subsection{Proof of dual pair in Proposition 4.4}

Reviewer 3 pointed out that there was still a problem with our proof
that $J_L^{(k)}$ and $J_R^{(k)}$ form a dual pair.

We agree with the reviewer's observation and after closer inspection
we are convinced that $J_L^{(k)}$ and $J_R^{(k)}$ indeed do not form
dual pair for $k \ge 1$, although they do for $k = 0$. However, for
$k \ge 1$ they still form a weak dual pair, as defined and extensively
studied in the paper ``Dual pairs in fluid dynamics'' (2012) by
Gay-Balmaz and Vizman. This weakened definition only requires
\begin{equation*}
  \kernel(J_L^{(k)})^\omega \subset \kernel(J_R^{(k)}), \qquad
  \kernel(J_R^{(k)})^\omega \subset \kernel(J_L^{(k)}),
\end{equation*}
instead of strict equalities and is sufficient to prove Theorem~A.9
without modification (Theorem A.8 in the original version).

We have replaced `dual pair' by `weak dual pair' in appropriate places
with some remarks and modified our proofs. This actually simplified
the proofs, since we need only prove that the left and right actions
of $\SDiff(\R^n)$ and $\iso(z)$ commute to use Corollary~2.6 from the
Gay-Balmaz and Vizman paper.

\subsection{Reviewer 2 comments on Section 4.5}

Reviewer 2 mentions a number of unclarities in Section 4.5 ``Kelvin's
circulation theorem''. Below the comments and our responses.

\begin{itemize}
\item p.58 line 59--60 and p.57 line 1. It states ``the statement
  $\pi(p_\varphi)) = i(p_q)$ for some $p_\varphi \in T^*\SDiff(\R^n)$
  and \ldots $\Jet_z^{(k)}(w \circ \varphi)\rangle$.''.
  The equivalence is not obvious to me. Please clarify.

\item p.58 line 43 and line 53. it's not obvious the definition of
  $T^*\SDiff(\R^n)/\iso^{(k)}(z)$.
  Please describe the definition. Or should
  ``$T^*\SDiff(\R^n)/\iso^{(k)}(z)$''
  be ``$T^*\SDiff(\R^n)/\mathfrak{iso}^{(k)}(z)$''?

  The quotient is by the cotangent-lifted (right) action of
  $\iso^{(k)}(z)$. We have clarified this in the text.

\item p.58 line 49. In this context, it's not obvious to me whether
  this $\mathfrak{iso}^*(z)$ is the dual of $\iso^{(k)}(z)$ or
  $\iso(z)$. Please describe the definition.

  It is the dual of $\iso^{(k)}(z)$; this was a sloppy
  notation oversight. We clarified this by explicitly writing
  $\mathfrak{iso}^{(k)}(z)^*$.

\item p.58 line 43. In this context, it's not obvious that ``we can
  consider the element $i(q, p) \in T^*\SDiff(\R^n)$ \ldots (2.2.4)].''.
  Please describe in detail. Or should ``$i(q,p) \in T^*\SDiff(\R^n)$''
  be ``$i(q,p) \in T^*\SDiff(\R^n) / \iso^{(k)}(z)$''?

  Indeed, this was a typo and we have corrected it to
  ``$i(q,p) \in T^*\SDiff(\R^n) / \iso^{(k)}(z)$''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Typos}
Reviewer 2 found the following (extra) typos. We could not exactly
reproduce the line numbers given by the reviewer; in parentheses is
specified the text position we assumed was meant.
\begin{itemize}
\item p.56 line 17 (line 32--33). ``$\delta_{\gamma_n}^{[b_n]}$'' should be ``$\delta_{\gamma_n}^{[j_n]}$''.
\item p.69 line 19 (line 40). ``transitive'' should be ``infinitesimally transitive''.
\item p.69 line 27 and line 34. I think that ``$\rho_1^*$'' should be
  ``$\rho_1$'', because of $\rho_1^*: G_1 \times T^*Q \to T^*Q$.

  We assume the reviewer refers to the use of ``$\rho_1^*$'' in
  Lemma~A.10 and its proof. We think this is technically correct, but
  confusing and inconsistent with previously established notation that
  ``$\rho_1$'' is the cotangent-lifted action.
\item p.69 line 34 (line 56). ``$q' = g \cdot q$'' should be ``$q' = g^{-1} \cdot q$''.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We agreed with these findings. The first we changed in the revised
manuscript, while the others are not relevant anymore since we removed
Theorem~A.9 and Lemma~A.10 following the issue pointed out by reviewer 3.
