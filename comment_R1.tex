\section{Typos}
Reviewer 2 found the following (extra) typos. We could not exactly
reproduce the line numbers given by the reviewer; in parentheses is
specified the text position we assumed was meant.
\begin{itemize}
\item p.56 line 17 (line 32--33). ``$\delta_{\gamma_n}^{[b_n]}$'' should be ``$\delta_{\gamma_n}^{[j_n]}$''.
\item p.69 line 19 (line 40). ``transitive'' should be ``infinitesimally transitive''.
\item p.69 line 27 and line 34. I think that ``$\rho_1^*$'' should be
  ``$\rho_1$'', because of $\rho_1^*: G_1 \times T^*Q \to T^*Q$.

  We assume the reviewer refers to the use of ``$\rho_1^*$'' in
  Lemma~A.10 and its proof. We think this is technically correct, but
  confusing and inconsistent with previously established notation that
  ``$\rho_1$'' is the cotangent-lifted action, so we changed all
  instances of ``$\rho_1^*$'' into ``$\rho_1$''.
\item p.69 line 34 (line 56). ``$q' = g \cdot q$'' should be ``$q' = g^{-1} \cdot q$''.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We agreed with these findings and changed them in the revised manuscript.
